# FoodPod

A basic project to build (and program) a robot with my kids.

The robot is like a train and is supposed to distribute food on our dining
table. Therefore the train runs on rails and is powered by two big motors.
Furthermore you can put in laying bricks in the color green and red on the rails
and the robot changes direction when reaching it.
